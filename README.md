This is the fourth(?) in a - hopefully short - series of ""design"" projects.

This GitHub interface is prettier and that's about it.

If you do not like the gradient or if you are like me and you like changing colors all the time, you can change the colors directly through Stylus' UI. It's pretty neat and instantaneous. I also added a toggle for the grainy texture and the background now comes with three options: 
- Animated gradient (default)
- Static gradient
- No gradient

The mosaic also comes in plenty of color options with fancy names such as Cyber Ocean or Electric Forest. It has a wave and everything but you can disable all of that by selecting "none" in the Stylus options.

### Installation 

Install the css using Stylus. You can get Stylus through the following links: 

-   [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
-   [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)

Once you have Stylus, you can install it directly clicking here:

There used to be JS userscripts but they are now deprecated because I think it's important to stay as close as possible as the base GitHub UI which is already pretty damn cool. 

### Fonts & Styles

I made an add-on that lets you change some of the fonts and colors of the interface. You can find and install the add-on here:

The add-on uses fonts from the Monaspace project and requires you to install them on your computer. They are pretty cool and use fancy words like *Texture Healing*, you should get them.

It also uses the following font if installed on your computer: 

- CC Wild Words.
